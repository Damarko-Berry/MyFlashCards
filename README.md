for the sake of my sanity, MVP, and the trees. I've created a flash card maker.

you can also create cards for each subjuct you might be studying. study guides are great, but note taking/flash card making cam be good for memorization.

The program is about 20,480 bytes(20kb) and each card should be less than 2kb(252 bytes depending).
